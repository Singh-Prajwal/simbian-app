# Simbian AI Experience Interface

I've analyzed the project requirements and implemented a modern, interactive Next.js 14 interface that vividly contrasts security operations with and without Simbian AI. The implementation uses Framer Motion for fluid animations that show the transition from chaotic alert overload to intelligent automation. The design features responsive cards that track alert metrics, real-time notification animations, and a step-by-step visualization of Simbian's workflow - all optimized for mobile, tablet and desktop viewing. The UI employs a clean color scheme transitioning from urgent reds to calming greens, with subtle motion effects enhancing the storytelling element while maintaining performance.
## Libraries & Tools Used

- [Next.js 14 (App Router)]
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide Icons
- Proxima Nova (font via CSS import)

## Known Issues & Future Improvements

- **Animation reset** currently relies on viewport logic; adding intersection observers with dynamic animation resets would improve scroll replay reliability.
- **Navbar animations** could be enhanced further with animated menus and transitions.
- Accessibility improvements (ARIA labels, keyboard nav) are planned.
- Would add tests (unit + interaction) and a CMS-based content system for scalability.
